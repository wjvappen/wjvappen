I am Wilken-Jon von Appen, an observational physical oceanographer at AWI.

I offer a yearly at-sea teaching cruise on RV _Heincke_.

Among other interesting things, I study the dynamics in Fram Strait.

Together with Rebecca Woodgate and Laura de Steur, I am one of the co-chairs of the [Arctic-Subarctic Ocean Fluxes](https://asof.awi.de/) community.
